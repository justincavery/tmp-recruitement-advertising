The Royal College of Nursing isn’t a college and it doesn’t often recruit nurses, it’s a membership and trade union organisation. To increase applications and fill essential managerial, technical and specialist roles, they needed help in educating their target audiences about the organisation and the opportunities it offers.

## Solution Highlights

* PRODUCED ENGAGING ONLINE VIDEO
* INCREASED WEBSITE TRAFFIC
* GENERATED INTEREST IN EMPLOYER
* FOUND NEW CANDIDATE AUDIENCES

## Scope and Scale

Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is a membership organisation and trade union with over 432,000 members in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1916, it has a proud history of transforming the role of women in medicine, supporting war efforts, embracing technological leaps and fighting for changes to the NHS.

But, to ensure its future, the RCN needed to increase awareness of – and interest in – the organisation and the range of careers it offers.

## Situation

Our audience was comprised of lots of people who wouldn’t imagine that the RCN had anything to offer them. Roles available included leadership, managerial and specialist professionals — from tech to legal, finance to HR. 

We had to excite them with the story of a surprisingly smart, progressive organisation offering the chance to join a stand-out generation of modernisers.

## Solution

Our solution was a rallying cry that fused heritage with future. Using detailed photography, CGI, actors and advanced editing techniques, we gave past RCN presidents a voice again. This bold and powerful film – featuring a series of remarkable, revolutionary women from history – was hosted on YouTube, showcased on the RCN careers site and promoted through a wide range of social channels.

## Results

People sat up and took notice. The film – and the marketing drive that signposted it – opened the eyes and minds of many thousands of new professionals to the RCN. An organisation many either weren’t aware of or didn’t know recruited
people like them.

* **370,893** – YouTube views (235,923 watched the whole 90 seconds). RCN videos normally have 500-1,000 views.
* **344%** – Enormous increase in visitors to the RCN careers site. Some months only see approximately 10,000 a month; January 2018 (after the film had gone live) saw 34,404 – an increase of over 344%.
* **50%** – Like-for-like roles saw applications up by around 50%.
* **100** – Increase in candidates signing up to job alerts (one of the core aims of the campaign)by over 100 per month.
