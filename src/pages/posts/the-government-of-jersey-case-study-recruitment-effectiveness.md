## The Challenge:

Recruit Social Workers, Managers and Senior Staff, and reduce hugely expensive and totally unsustainable agency careworker usage.

The Government of Jersey’s recruitment campaign was launched against the backdrop of huge changes to social care structures on the island, caused by a damning report into historical child abuse cases dating back to 1945.

> As a result, Jersey’s reputationhad suffered enormously.

The Government of Jersey desperately needed to recruit

* permanent social workers
* team managers
* senior practitioners

This was part of an effort to reduce its reliance on agency workers, which were **hugely expensive** and **totally**
**unsustainable**. Especially given the size of the turnaround they were confronted with.

## What did we do?

**Strategy: The truth on every level.**

In every channel, we chose to tell the Jersey story with robust, unvarnished – occasionally brutal – honesty.
