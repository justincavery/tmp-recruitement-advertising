## The Challenge:

Recruit Social Workers, Managers and Senior Staff, and reduce hugely expensive and totally unsustainable agency careworker usage.

The Government of Jersey’s recruitment campaign was launched against the backdrop of huge changes to social care structures on the island, caused by a damning report into historical child abuse cases dating back to 1945.

> As a result, Jersey’s reputationhad suffered enormously.

The Government of Jersey desperately needed to recruit

* permanent social workers
* team managers
* senior practitioners

This was part of an effort to reduce its reliance on agency workers, which were **hugely expensive** and **totally** **unsustainable**. Especially given the size of the turnaround they were confronted with.

## What did we do?

**Strategy: The truth on every level.**

In every channel, we chose to tell the Jersey story with robust, unvarnished – occasionally brutal – honesty.

### The letter 

This diverse campaign led with a letter – appearing as a print ad in the Guardian, the Jersey Evening Post and Professional Social Work magazine. The point was to be seen by the industry, be thought-provoking, get  people talking, use bold language and inspire trust and interest in equal measure. This was more
than a recruitment ad, it was a call to arms.

### Online

Using Guardian Jobs, Community Care and Social Media allowed the Government of Jersey to grab the attention of active and passive job seekers alike.

### Events

Having a prominent presence at key events allowed the organisation to follow up the strongly worded messaging with immediate one-to-one candidate conversations.

## Results

### PR

The campaign captured wide-ranging attention. There was lots of local press coverage and the Minister appeared on television to discuss the campaign.

### Recruitment

More importantly, the campaign has brought an impressive number of outstanding children’s social workers to the island. And it isn’t finished yet.

> “ I just wanted to say a big thank you to all at TMP for your excellent support and guidance through the development of the high profile and complex “Let’s Be Honest” Recruitment Campaign. There was a lot
> of hard work on everyone’s part and it’s a great example of partnership working. We know deadlines were tight but you always delivered on time, to a very high standard and all the team enjoyed working with you. Capturing the nuances of living and working on Jersey was always a tough ask, but I believe your team caught the spirit of the Island and appreciated the subtleties required for a successful recruitment campaign for Children’s Services.”
