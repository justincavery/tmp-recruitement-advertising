## The Challenge

University of Reading have limited presence within the tech recruitment market as an employer and have traditionally advertised through job boards. This lack of presence is also compounded by public sector level salaries and their location. The M4 corridor is a true tech hub in the UK with 100’s of competitors looking for the same candidates. The team have needed this hire for some time and it was vital that a hire was made quickly on a limited advertising budget.

## The Approach

We used a combination of media for the active and passive market. However, this role has been advertised previously and the quality and quantity of response was much higher thanks to SNAP. The hiring manager was well engaged and used his own social media channels to promote the role.

> “We had 10 applications and are interviewing 5 of those over the next week and this is more than we had previously. In general it looks like we reached a wider cross section and probably had better candidates that we had previously. It has done well enough for us to put in two more jobs, around security.” Anton **Lawrence, Assistant Director of IT**
