## Scope and Scale

To feed their ongoing requirement for Band 5 Nurses, St George’s NHS wanted to promote a nursing open day. They wanted to stand out from their competitors in London and the surrounding areas, but also create a successful campaign within a quick timescale. 

## Situation

The London nursing market is extremely competitive, with over 1500 nursing roles being advertised within a 25-mile radius of St George’s Hospital. Due to open day date fast approaching, St George’s also needed to raise awareness but only gave us a short amount of time to complete the work.

## Solution

### Research & Discovery

The SNAP team researched the different audiences within the healthcare industry in order to create tailored social messages on each channel used. 

### Foundation & Framework

Along with a half-page print advertisement in a local newspaper, St George’s used the SNAP (Social Network Amplification Platform) package which includes Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Google Display Network. 

### Outcome 

Through SNAP, we were able to target our content at the newsfeeds of relevant individuals within the nursing/healthcare industry and promote the open day to candidates within a 25-mile radius of London.

## Results

* 180,487 impressions
* 2,692 website clicks
* 75 attended
* 56 Interviewed
* 54 hires 

> “We interviewed 56 candidates and made 54 offers, which was really great for us. Hopefully the first of the cohort should be starting with us in the next week -- so a quick turnaround, which is excellent”. \
