The University of Manchester’s Presidential Fellowship invited the world’s brightest academics to become inspiring leaders of the future by delivering world-leading research and teaching at the University.

Attracting and engaging candidates to fit this high calibre brief called for an innovative yet cost effective solution.

## Solution Highlights

* ALL FELLOWSHIPS FILLED
* CREATED 3.2 MILLION VIEWS AND OVER 30,000 CLICKS

* 32% OF INTEREST GENERATED FROM OUTSIDE THE UK

## Scope and Scale

As part of the strategic approach, we identified that TMP’s unique social media awareness programme, SNAP would prove invaluable in reaching our target audience. We would need to contact prospects with particular
interest in this opportunity as well as those who could meet the selection criteria. Our SNAP solution ensured that we would deliver to the project timeframe and within the agreed budget.

## Situation

In this highly competitive market with so much social media noise, it was imperative that our messaging was
precise and that our delivery was highly targeted. The criteria for success was very specific and a strong communications plan was essential to reach the correct audience in a global dimension.

## Solution

Through SNAP, we were able to target our content to relevant individuals, interest groups, communities and
professional associations who may otherwise not have seen this outstanding opportunity. We directed candidates to a bespoke microsite that detailed the working environment, described the USP and illustrated the impact that the University’s researchers have had globally (including the work of 25 Nobel Prize winners).

We also created a door-opening advert which was shared with relevant individuals to encourage conversation
across all channels and to raise brand awareness.

## Results

Across five social media channels, we generated 3.2 million views with over 30,000 clicks, 32% from outside the UK – a KPI of the project.
This relatively low budget, fast turnaround campaign exceeded all expectations. It achieved its objectives particularly around engagement of passive candidates and securing an international reach. We tracked this
activity using analytics and insight to produce a detailed report at the end of the campaign. This demonstrated the impact of the project across each Faculty.

SNAP is now a central platform for all recruitment for the University and is used to pinpoint specific locations as well as to target a more diverse audience.
