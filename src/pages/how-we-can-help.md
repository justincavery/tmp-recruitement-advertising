Through the frameworks and contracts that you already have in place with us, you will receive a **discount** for buying your recruitment advertising but only via TMP.

We are the number one agency for purchasing recruitment media and as such, this means that we can help you negotiate better deals on your behalf by utilising our buying power.

Over the last 5 years, we have **saved our clients over £11 million** this way!

Not only that, but we will give you **impartial** **free advice** on the best media channels to use, supported with stats and results as to what actually works. We can keep you updated as to the latest options on the market, not only with the more traditional options such as online but also social.

Let us help you navigate the ever-changing and complex world of recruitment media and make it cheaper at the same time.

With specialist job boards for every sector, and larger job boards that advertise across *all* sectors, there is a confusing array of choices to be made. Pick the wrong board, and you could see your ideal candidate slip through the net – and even end up working for a competitor. We hate to see that happen to our clients, so let us guide you through the hundreds of options.

With an exceptional network of contacts spanning every conceivable sector and a cutting-edge understanding of the most effective outlets that will generate results for you, they take the guess work – and the endless hours of admin – out of your talent search.

## Social Media — it couldn’t be easier
